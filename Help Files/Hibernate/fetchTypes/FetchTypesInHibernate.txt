Fetch Types are used when we are using relations among the tables like @OneToMany.

fetch type is an attribute of the above annotation. 
Syntax:  @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)


So the fetch type specifies when to load the related object. LAZY tells to load the related object's data only when it(particular getter) is called by making a DB call via some proxy.

And when we use EAGER, all the related object's data is loaded when the initial DB call happened itself. if we keep show_sql=true, we can see the firing of queries
