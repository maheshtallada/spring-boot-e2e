Various forms of using ResponseEntity : https://www.baeldung.com/spring-response-entity
2 Examples in UserController


TO find classes from Jars where we do not know the exact name of the class : https://www.baeldung.com/eclipse-find-class
Ex: Ctrl+shift+T to get "Open Type" dialog


Alt + Shift + L -- to assign the result to a local variable
Ex: 1. we can type the following "users.iterator();"
	2. we have to hold "Alt + Shift + L" and in pop-up, can type the name of the variable if needed or can leave to the default
	3. the result is the below
Iterator<User> iterator = users.iterator();


Internationalization is also called i18n (because of the number of letters, 18, between “i” and “n”)


Ctrl+Shift+O	-- organize imports
Ctrl+O 			-- search for a method in the class
Ctrl+Shift+F	-- Format the Code
Ctrl + T		-- To get Type Hierarchy of a class (toggle between supertype and subtype hierarchy)
Ctrl+Shift+R	-- Open Resource (Class)
Alt + (up)/(down)	--	place cursor on a particular line/block and click this Alt + U/D to move the code U/D
